DriveControl:
- fix DriveDist Fake Encoder - Needs Testing
- Fix DriveDist Function(Implement encoder shit)
- Implement stopDriveDist function() - Needs Testing
- add stopOpenLoopDrive function - test
DriveForwardAuton:
- Add function stop function to work with drive control stopDriveDist 

Main:
- Fix allowed to enable more than once(And disable) - test

Autonomous:
- Add steer logic, distance logic, and sensor logic to Smart Auton
- disable controller inputting to drivecontrol class, make controller stick values not effect drive - test
- smaartauton: Make the avoidobstacle only stop turning if the distance is within a certain value(Smaller value then the first trigger value.)

DriveControl:
- Track TOTAL ticks traveled, this is NEEDED to keep track of distance, otherwise the distance wont be accurate 

Service:
-

General stuff:
- set bluetooth address
- add all status variables to variables class(eg. connected)
- check if global flag for variable at top of the class removes the need for repeated global declarations in functions

Controller:
- Fix allowed to enable more than once(And disable) - test

Sensor:
- Possibly delete CollisionSensor Class
- CollisionSensor Class: Update pass in socket in init method, socket wont be valid after client restart
