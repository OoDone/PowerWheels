DriveControl:
- fix DriveDist Fake Encoder - Needs Testing
- Fix DriveDist Function(Implement Real encoder shit) - Test
- Implement stopDriveDist function() - Needs Testing
- fix encoder counts forwards while moving backwards, counts up both directions
DriveForwardAuton:
- Add function stop function to work with drive control stopDriveDist - test

Main:
- Fix allowed to enable more than once(And disable) - test

Autonomous:
- Add steer logic, distance logic, and sensor logic to Smart Auton
- disable controller inputting to drivecontrol class, make controller stick values not effect drive - test
- smaartauton: Make the avoidobstacle only stop turning if the distance is within a certain value(Smaller value then the first trigger value.)

Vision:
- Test new multiprocessing for smartauton vision and loop. - test


Service:
-

General stuff:
- add all status variables to variables class(eg. connected)
- check if global flag for variable at top of the class removes the need for repeated global declarations in functions

Controller:

Sensor:
- CollisionSensor Class: Update pass in socket in init method, socket wont be valid after client restart
